I recently came across an insightful article titled "10 Things Software Developers Should Learn About Learning" by Neil C.C. Brown. This article dives into cognitive psych and educational research to explore how devs can enhance their learning. It offers practical advice on topics like the human memory, the differeces between expert and novice thinking, and strategies for better knowledge retention. What I found most interesting was the discussions on the limitations of working memory and the idea of chunking info for deeper learning. The article also highlights the concept of a growth mindset, encouraging software engineers to view challenges as growth opportunities.
