I recently came across an insightful article titled **"10 Things Software Developers Should Learn About Learning"** by Neil C. C. Brown. This article dives into cognitive psychology and educational research to explore how developers can improve the way they learn.

It offers practical insights on topics such as human memory, the differences between expert and novice thinking, and strategies for better knowledge retention. What I found most interesting was the discussion around the limitations of working memory and the idea of *chunking* information to support deeper learning. The article also emphasizes a growth mindset, encouraging software engineers to view challenges as opportunities for growth.
